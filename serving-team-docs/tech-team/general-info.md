# General Information

## Who are we
The Tech Serving Team works behind the scenes, providing the audio-visual support needed to ensure smooth program flow and the success of worship services and special events.
We are artists who present with excellence. We value detail and precision. We are the primary and strongest support for everyone on stage.

## Mission
To pursue excellence wherever we serve—using our God-given skills and talents to bless others, honor God, and bring glory to His name.

## Vision
To advance God’s Kingdom by providing excellent technical support for our movement, while intentionally discipling and empowering one another as we serve together.

## Core Values
### Discipleship
- We grow together to become more like Christ.
- Give grace freely as we all learn and grow.
### Excellence
- We honor God by giving our very best.
### Servant Leadership
- We lead with love, not position.
- We are here to serve, not to impress.
- Stay humble, stay teachable.

## Technical Serving Team Guidelines
- **Respect the Workspace**: Keep the booth clean and organized. No food or beverages allowed. Always practice CLAYGO (Clean As You Go).
- **Take Ownership**: Properly set up and pack away all equipment (e.g., computers off, cameras neatly stored).
- **Be Prepared**: Study the program details thoroughly and come ready to serve.
- **Dress Appropriately**: Wear neat, casual attire (closed footwear, no shorts or revealing clothes). Wearing black is recommended to blend in behind the scenes.
- **Be on Time**: Arrive at least 1 hour before your scheduled serving time. Inform your ministry coordinator immediately if you’ll be late or if an emergency arises.
- **Communicate Absences Clearly**: If unable to serve, arrange for a teammate to cover your responsibilities, brief them properly, and promptly notify your team leader by chat, text, or call.
- **Embrace Feedback**: Regularly evaluate your service and openly receive constructive feedback to help our team continuously improve.
- **Honor Confidentiality**: Respect the confidentiality of church materials and honor copyright guidelines.
